# Azul-Java
An implementation of the award-winning board game Azul in Java.

I have not requested rights to Azul, but I do personaly own a physical copy of the game.  This is not intended for distribution, merely a tool for me to play with friends that live in other states.

All images are edited from photos I took of my copy of the game.
